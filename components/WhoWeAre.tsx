              <p>
                I grew up inside operating environments where the smell of fresh bread at sunrise
                mattered just as much as the numbers at close of trade. Where people, process, and
                pressure intersected every day.
              </p>

              <p>
                For nearly three decades, retail was my classroom. From the shop floor to leading
                national strategy at{" "}
                <span className="font-medium text-neutral-900">SPAR Group</span>, I learned how real
                businesses work — and why many fail.
              </p>

              <p>
                I’ve turned struggling stores around, built teams that cared, and learned to
                measure success in more than just margin. Along the way, I had the privilege of
                serving as <span className="font-medium text-neutral-900">Mr SPAR (2013)</span>,
                helping launch SPAR in{" "}
                <span className="font-medium text-neutral-900">Mauritius and India</span>, turning
                around the{" "}
                <span className="font-medium text-neutral-900">EUROSPAR format in Ireland</span>,
                and serving on the{" "}
                <span className="font-medium text-neutral-900">
                  National Executive Committee
                </span>{" "}
                of a JSE-listed retailer.
              </p>

              <p>
                And then I walked away. Not because I was done — but because I wanted to test
                everything I had learned with my own capital, my own people, and my own risk.
              </p>

              <div className="rounded-2xl border border-neutral-200 bg-neutral-50 p-5">

                Today, <span className="font-medium text-neutral-900">we</span> build, own, and
                operate businesses across grocery retail, liquor, and franchised café
                environments.

              <p>We live with:</p>

                <li>• Tight margins and working capital pressure</li>

                <li>• Daily operational decisions that compound over time</li>
                <li>• Compliance, governance, and accountability that can’t be outsourced</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                We’ve achieved consistent growth — but growth isn’t the point. What matters is
                building businesses that hold under pressure, develop people into leaders, and
                create places customers trust and communities support.
              </p>

              <p>We don’t bring theory to operators. We bring judgement shaped by responsibility.</p>

                  Retail reflects the effort, care, and courage of the people behind it. That’s
                  why we show up every day — to build, to lead, to grow, and to leave things
                  stronger than we found them.
